# ProtoType

Need to `pip install -e my_package` for the **Prototype** dependent packages.

## `my_package`
Contains some stuff that might be needed throughout the prototype (and these should probably make it into some `common` package for the "real" app)

## `my_site`
Django web server to test out requests and whatnot

### login
Testing the user authorization endpoint

## `my_first_request.py`
Random requests to test out the endpoint.
